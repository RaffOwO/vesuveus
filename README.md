# Vesuveus - The Smol Ergonomic Mechanical Keyboard

Hey there! Welcome to Vesuveus, a cute and ergonomic mechanical keyboard! This little wonder is heavily inspired by the nine-nano by bsag and the atreus, and I'm super excited to tell you all about it.

## What's Vesuveus Anyway?

Vesuveus is a compact, pocketable keyboard with 40 keys that packs a punch! It's carefully designed to be your trusty sidekick for every task, whether you're coding, designing, or just having some typing fun.

It's name /*v…õÀàsuÀêviu…ôs*/ is derived by the volcano ___Vesuvius___ at Naples.

## Why 40 Keys?

You might wonder why I settled on 40 keys, right? Well, I tried everything from 34 to 48 keys, and this magical 40-key layout is the sweet spot for me! Let me break it down for you:

- **34 or 36 layouts** are great for programmers and have a minimal footprint. But they drive me crazy when I switch to mouse-centric apps like Inkscape or PowerPoint. I need those modifier keys and an arrow cluster, man! That's why keyboards like the bgkeeb from sakebaroudi and ferris sweep couldn't fully satisfy my needs.

- On the other hand, **46 or 48 layouts** feel like chaos and totally ignore the whole ergonomic idea. I mean, making my pinky press 4 to 6 keys? That's madness! Even with some cheats like using my ring finger for the top row, my pinky still ends up responsible for 4 keys. It just doesn't feel right and isn't ergonomic at all.

So, the **40-key layout** gives me the best of both worlds - it's usable, comfortable, and doesn't take up too much space. I believe it achieves the perfect balance between usability, comfort, and dimensions.

**Note**: I think that adding a extra side key for the pinky can be great (see the TOTEM layout) because we are accustomed to stretching the pinky sideways, but this would occupy more space on the desk and on the 3D printer, so I didn't feel to include that.

## No Split Keyboard? Hear Me Out!

Yep, Vesuveus is a **unibody design**, and I know you might be thinking, "Why not go split?" Well, here's the deal:

- **Split keyboards** have their perks, no doubt! I appreciate the adjustable positions for your shoulders; it's all about that ergonomic goodness. But they come with their own set of drawbacks too - like dealing with multiple MCUs or tangled cables. Plus, when you're on the go like me, a unibody is a lifesaver! It's easy to carry around, and the angled configuration still keeps my shoulders happy. Oh, and it plays nice with the mouse too! The last thing I want is a twist game on my desk trying to reach my mouse.

### Atreus? Nah, I Got This!

Some folks might ask, "Why didn't you just get an Atreus?" Well, let me tell you:

- I like my **pinky stagger strong**, so Atreus's weaker stagger wouldn't be comfy for me.

- Gotta have that **classic arrow cluster** for my work, and Atreus didn't quite cut it for that. It's an essential part of my workflow, and I don't want to miss it.

- The **thumb keys** on Atreus are too high up; I prefer them a bit lower for that perfect feel. It's all about those little details that make a difference in daily use.

- And don't get me started on the **uneven stagger** and that funky top row! I like my keyboard to be consistent and uniform. I know, it's a bit nitpicky, but it's just how I roll.

So, I put my quirky preferences and design philosophies to work and created the ultimate balance - Vesuveus!

## Why Handwired? Ain't Got Time for PCBs!

Now, I know some of you might wonder why I went handwired. Truth is, I'd love to make a PCB, but hey, learning Kicad takes time, and I'm busy creating magic with Vesuveus! Besides, there's a certain charm to handwiring - it's like crafting something special with your own hands.

**Note**: If you're interested in collaborating and working on PCBs or creating revisions with a tented nature, I'd be more than thrilled to team up! Let's improve Vesuveus together and explore new possibilities.

Still, once I have the knowledge and skill to manage Kicad, I would love to release a PCB version with some good-looking silkscreens!

## Should You Try Vesuveus?

Hey, if my madness intrigues you, why not give Vesuveus a try? I'd be more than happy to include your contributions or ideas in this project! Feel free to get in touch, and let's make some keyboard magic together! üòÑ
